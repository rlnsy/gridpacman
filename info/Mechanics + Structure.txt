  -Ghost Movement Modes
  -Target Tiles
  -Basic Ghost Movement Rules
  -Individual Ghost Personalities
  
  Ghost Behaviours:
	Make turns based on target tile
	Cannot turn at 4-way intersections, go straight to opposite side
	(Except in frightened mode)
	
	Modes:
		Chase
			Normal mode
		Scatter
			Ghost targets all = tiles at corners of board
		Frightened
			Ghosts randomly decide turns
			Ghosts are blue and can be eaten
		
	Blinky(Red):
		Starts outside ghost house
		Target = PacMan
		Special Cruise Elroy mode
	Pinky:
		Starts in ghost house
		target = four tiles ahead of PacMan
	Inky(Blue):
		Stays in ghost house until PacMan has eaten 30 dots
		"draw line" from Blinky to (2 spaces in front of PacMan), double the line to target tile
	Clyde(Orange):
		Doesn't leave ghost house until a third of the dots have been eaten
		if more than 8 tiles from PacMan, target = PacMan
		if less than 8 tiles from PacMan, target = Scatter mode target
